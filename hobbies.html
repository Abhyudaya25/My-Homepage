		<h4>Programming</h4>
		
		<p>
			Programming is my favourite hobby. In the period of Corona virus and lockdown, I learnt coding and programming. I enjoy coding very much.
			After wasting at least three months of time in this lockdown, my father told me about coding and programming. At that time, I didn't knew anything
			about coding or programming. So, I started learning how to code and now I can say that I have some knowledge in this absolutely new field, 
			particularly in Python, C, HTML, CSS, SQL, and a little in Javascript. I particularly like Web development, but I am still learning it. This 
			website is also a result of my newly learnt programming skills.
		</p>
		<h4>Dancing</h4>
		<p>
			My second favourite hobby is dancing. I like to dance very much. Whenever I hear any of my favourite songs playing, I with my sister start to 
			dance in my room. Sometimes, I also record my dance's videos.
		</p>
		<h4>Drawing</h4>
		<p>
			My next interest is drawing and sketching. I like black 'n white and colored sketching. Sometimes, I also do painting.
		</p>
		<h4>Astronomy</h4>
		<p>
			I also like astronomy. In the night sky, I like to spot Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, Mars and other heavenly bodies. My eldest cousin brother also 
			has a telescope. Sometimes, I convince him to join me in the night sky. I and my brothers and my sister have seen Jupiter, Venus and Saturn 
			from his telescope. I have also seen this year's, i.e., 2020's, brightest comet, NEOWISE comet from my brother's 'binaculars'. I have also seen 
			this year(2020)'s Lyrid meteor shower in the month of March.
